This is a url shortener website I made.
You can check it out [here](https://url-shortener.fusionsid.repl.co/)

How it works:
On the homepage you add a url and then the scrip generates a unique code for you.
Now when you add the code to the url: `https://url-shortener.fusionsid.repl.co/<code>`
The script checks the json file(I tried sql but thought json would be easier) for that code and if the code is in the json file. It will get the url to redirect to and redirect you to it - No ads, no ip grabbing, No wait 5 sec .

I got this idea last night at 2am when I was trying to sleep and pretty much planned all the code so it took me only 15 min today to write this script/website.
